- Addition (+)  
- Subtraction (-)  
- Multiplication (*)  
- Division (/)  

## Features  
✅ User-friendly input system  
✅ Handles division by zero with an error message  
✅ Runs continuously until the user chooses to exit  

## Usage  
1. Run the Python script.  
2. Enter two numbers.  
3. Choose an arithmetic operation.  
4. View the result.  
5. Repeat until you decide to exit.  

## Example Output  
Enter first number: 10
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): /
Enter second number: 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.



Sub Task 2: 🎯 Number Guessing Game

📌 Project Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. The program provides hints after each incorrect guess, helping the player reach the correct answer.

🔧 How It Works:
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The player enters a guess.
The program responds with hints:
Too high? Try a lower number.
Too low? Try a higher number.
The game continues until the correct number is guessed. 🎉

🚀 Technologies Used:
Python
Random module for number generation
Loops & Conditional Statements for game logic
User Input Handling

🖥️ How to Run the Game: 
Clone the repository or download the Python script.

Run the script in any Python environment:

##Tic Tac Toe Game

Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbol (X or O). The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

##Features
-Turn-based gameplay for two players
-Input validation to prevent invalid moves
-Automatic detection of wins and ties
-Interactive console-based UI


##How to Run the Game
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the tic_tac_toe.py script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the script.
4. Run the game using the command:
      python tic_tac_toe.py


##How to Play
1. The game starts by asking Player 1 to choose their symbol (X or O). Player 2 gets the opposite symbol.
2. Players take turns selecting a row and column to place their mark.
3. The game checks after each move for a win or a tie.
4. If a player wins, the game announces the winner and ends.
5. If the board is full with no winner, the game declares a tie.


##Game Rules
>>Players can only place their symbol in an empty cell.
>>A player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
>>If the board is full with no winner, the game results in a tie.



###Example Gameplay
Hello! Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
Player 1, do you want to be X or O? X
Player 2, you are O.

Here is the playboard:
