##Tic Tac Toe Game

Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbol (X or O). The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

##Features
-Turn-based gameplay for two players
-Input validation to prevent invalid moves
-Automatic detection of wins and ties
-Interactive console-based UI


##How to Run the Game
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the tic_tac_toe.py script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the script.
4. Run the game using the command:
      python tic_tac_toe.py


##How to Play
1. The game starts by asking Player 1 to choose their symbol (X or O). Player 2 gets the opposite symbol.
2. Players take turns selecting a row and column to place their mark.
3. The game checks after each move for a win or a tie.
4. If a player wins, the game announces the winner and ends.
5. If the board is full with no winner, the game declares a tie.


##Game Rules
>>Players can only place their symbol in an empty cell.
>>A player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
>>If the board is full with no winner, the game results in a tie.



###Example Gameplay
Hello! Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
Player 1, do you want to be X or O? X
Player 2, you are O.

Here is the playboard:
---+---+---
   |   |   
---+---+---
   |   |   
---+---+---
   |   |   

Player X, it is your turn.
Pick a row [0-2]: 1
Pick a column [0-2]: 1

---+---+---
   |   |   
---+---+---
   | X |   
---+---+---
